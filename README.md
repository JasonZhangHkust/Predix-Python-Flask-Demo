# Predix-Python-Flask-Demo
This is the Python Flask Demo for Predix 


My Flask app includes the following functions: 

1.         Basic http authentication 

2.         Primitive theme from Bootstrap 

3.         Form validation check with WTForm

4.         User info input & users profile retrieve with PostgreSQL and SQLAlchemy


But before pushing my script to Predix, please rewrite the conf.conf file using your own PostgreSQL service url(delete the [] also) and choose another password instead in .py file.
